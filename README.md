# praat-project
This is an assistant GUI software designed with Python for processing acoustic data created by Praat.  

The software is migrated from a Javascript-based web application, please refer to the folder /web-version.  

As the web-form application is restricted in the IE browser and sometimes may bring problems, a desktop GUI application may fix thes annoying issues.
